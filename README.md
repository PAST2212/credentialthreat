- Affected Network Resource from Base URL: Network Resource File / URL that is (get) requested / connected with BASE URL; e.g. https://www.agilecommunity.ottogroup.com/wLayout22/wGlobal/layout/scripts/juicer.js
- Registered Domain Base URL: Registered Domain of Base URL; e.g. ottogroup.com
- Credential Leak Candidate: Predicted leaked data,  e.g. ('app_id', '731223346944897') <br>

# **Notes**

**Author**
- Patrick Steinhoff (https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-steinhoff-168892222/)

**TO DO**
- PEP 8 Compliance
- Add new Regex

**Additional**
- URL Scan for leaked candidates were capped to 100.000 URLs due to performance, client/server capacity issues.
- Depending on the quantity of processed URLs, it can take a lot of time to make URL GET requests because of balancing / tradeoff relation between Speed, Parallel Processing Issues and DDOS Preventions.
- Credits goes to Bug Bounty Hunter h4x0r-dz and his project https://github.com/h4x0r-dz/Leaked-Credentials . This project is based on his regex
